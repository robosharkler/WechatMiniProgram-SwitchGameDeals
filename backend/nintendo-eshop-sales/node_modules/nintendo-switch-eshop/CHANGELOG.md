# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/lmmfranco/nintendo-switch-eshop/compare/v3.0.3...v4.0.0) (2020-10-31)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* use getQueriedGamesAmerica to get games based on a given query. For example when
your users can perform a search (just like on the nintendo.com website) you can use this to severly
limit the results to go through.
* The repo files have been moved around a lot. This probably won't impact
you too much, but if you were importing from a specific path (not the root of
require('nintendo-switch-eshop')) then you'll have to change your imports.
* **api:** getGamesAmerica no longer takes any parameters and
should always return all games.

## 2.2.2 (2019-08-24)

**Note:** Version bump only for package nintendo-switch-eshop





## [2.2.1] - 2019-08-05
### Fixes
- Fixed `getShopsByCountryCodes` by building with rollup-plugin-json included

## [2.2.0] - 2019-08-01
### Fixes
- Fixed `getGamesAmerica` to use the new Algolia based API. At last! Many thanks to @endy124 for their work on this!

### Changed
- Restructured project
  - Now produces optimal bundles with Rollup
  - Proper JSDoc generation
  - Keeping a changelog
  - Cleaner editorconfig and thus coding style
  - GitHub issue and pull request and a contributing guide
  - Better CircleCI configuration

## [2.1.1] - 2019-02-26
### Fixes
- Moved `@types/country-data` to devDependencies thinking that would be okay but apparently it is not as it breaks TypeScript builds. So sorry! This should fix these kind of errors that were present in v2.1.0:

## [2.1.0] - 2019-02-26
### Fixes
- Get rid of Gulp for development environment => NPM Scripts suffice just fine
- Move `@types` to devDependencies where they belong => No more installed along with the package
- Change to terser-folder => Better ES6 support
- Fixed looping in `getGamesAmerica` => The lib loops for you again now, sorry for breaking that!
- Fixed looping in `getPrices` => Related to the other looping issue, now fixed again!

### Added
- Expose `GameUS`, `GameEU` and `GameJP` interface for TypeScript users
- Allow for the `getGamesAmerica` `shop` property to be `'unfiltered'`. This will remove the property from the API request and return everything possible

### Changed
- We now also test that looping of `getGamesAmerica` works properly
